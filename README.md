HI I WROTE SOME NOTES. if u guys want to change anything or think the development is going in the wrong direction just sound out. i write a lot of instructions cus i think itll be easier for u guys if u hv some kind of direction but dont need to 100% follow ah

https://dell-innovatedash-gxeunr41p-gabriels-projects-83e3cc50.vercel.app

# Set-up
how to run the repository (can paste this thing into chatgpt if youre unfamiliar)
<using vscode>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielxKuek/dell-innovatedash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Yi Ning
- i think the most important first thing u shd settle is the flow of qns and answers
- so figure out the kind of quizzes, how many quizzes we're gonna have + what questions + what kind of flow it's gonna be like
- lmk if im deviating too much or if you wanna go different direction also, im a bit worried of that
- can work with jia yik if you want to integrate any assets to the game too. can change the gameplay flow jus lmk
- i trust u to qa

#### note
- the questions flow is in client/src/data/treatmentData.js
- each file (eg treatmentData.js) is meant to be one "quiz", can study the decision tree to see what the format is like ah
- i just chatgpt this tree cus i tired so might change a little. rn its all decisions in one file, but format should be relatively similar
- click on group > pull data from appropriate file > display qna stuff

### Jia Yik
- dear assets, i think u shd work with yi ning on what assets to have cus im thinking he can be the one to decide what types of quizzes and questions to do
- rafael and gabriel just be humble slaves that code wtv u guys say ah
- also dont limit yourself to what we have, if you think of smt new just let us know we can code it out, legit anything. can even be like some animation play when the message is loading, some music play when a message gets sent, some character talking when u open the chat idk legit anything just let us know
- the white space around the phone also not utilized, i leave it uty if uw do anything with that ah
- music might be something we want to add in the bg? idk food for thought
- i trust u to qa

### Ace
- doing slides i hv trust in u can ask in chat if u got anything to clarify abt product i worried our progress slow
- whenever ur leap camp over and u got more time let us know, we can move work ard so u are more involved in the product

### Joen
- the ai stuff idk how its gonna go tbh but if its ever too much can alw lmk and you can join rafael and gabriel as development slaves to yi ning and jia yik and ace
